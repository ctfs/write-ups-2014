# CTF write-ups

There are some problems with CTF write-ups in general:

* they’re scattered across the interwebs
* they don’t usually include the original files needed to solve the challenge
* some of them are incomplete or skip ‘obvious’ parts of the explanation, and are therefore not as helpful for newcomers
* often they disappear when the owner forgets to renew their domain or shuts down their blog

This repository aims to solve those problems.

It’s a collection of CTF source files and write-ups that anyone can contribute to. Did you just publish a CTF write-up? [Let us know](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups/issues/new), and we’ll add a link to your post — or just add the link yourself and submit a pull request. Spot an issue with a solution? Correct it, and send a pull request.
