# Pico CTF 2014 : Crude Crypt

**Category:** Binary Exploitation
**Points:** 180
**Description:**

>Without proper maintainers, development of [Truecrypt](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/
) has stopped! CrudeCrypt has emerged as a notable alternative in the open source community. The author has promised it is 'secure' but we know better than that. Take a look at the code and read the contents of flag.txt from the server! The problem is at /home/crudecrypt/crude_crypt on the shell server.

**Hint:**
>You can never trust user input!
