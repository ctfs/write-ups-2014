# Pico CTF 2014 : Make A Face

**Category:** Web Exploitation
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

>It looks like Daedalus is working on a new project to generate digital avatars for use online. After taking a look, at their site: http://makeaface.picoctf.com/ it seems like there is a pretty good chance the project isn't completed, and may have some bugs. This might be the break we've been looking for to get inside their network.

**Hint:**
>Making a face is cool, but making a shell is even better
