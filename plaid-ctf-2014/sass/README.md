# Plaid CTF 2014: sass

**Category:** Pwnables
**Points:** 200
**Description:**

> Not all of The Plagues services seem secure. Getting into [this one](sass-3b23e61c9defaf34f7111ba425f12208.gz), might give us some clues as to when he is planning to time jump to next. The service is at 54.198.50.139:5455; you may also want to `ssh` to `ctf@54.198.50.139` (password: `ctf`) to debug your exploits in the local environment. Read the `README_SASS` there!
