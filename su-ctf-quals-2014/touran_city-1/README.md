# Sharif University Quals CTF 2014: Tourcan City-1

**Category:** Recon
**Points:** 150
**Solves** 48
**Description:**

> Due to economic downturns and lack of resources, Monsters Inc. has decided to scare kids regularly door to door, instead of using their teleport technology. Their office in Touran City has developed an Android app, which is used by the head office to communicate with the monsters (i.e. transmit new assignments to them). Recently, the Touran City Police Department (TCPD) tracked and captured a thief and found a cell phone on him. It seems that the thief had stolen the cell phone from one of the Monsters Inc. employees. A backup of the cell phone is attached.
