# DEFKTHON CTF: Reversing 200

**Description:**

> [Segmentation Fault](200)

## Write-up

_This write-up is made by the [HacknamStyle](http://hacknamstyle.net/) CTF team._

The file is a normal Linux 32-bit ELF binary. Open it up in IDA and we see theres a `main` function and a `lol` function. The reverse engineered main function corresponds to the code below. I inlined several comments to explain what the code is trying to accomplish.

```
int main()
{
  int pipefd[2];
  int pid;
  int userinput;
  char kidid[30];

  // Create pipe for communication between child and parent
  pipe(pipefd);

  pid = fork();
  if ( !pid )
  {
    // ----- Start Child Process -----

    // Send Kid ID to the parent process using the pipe
    puts("\nDamn!! i lost my Kid's ID");
    write(pipefd[1], "42447255344574653276838751", 29);

    // Fake segmentation fault message and exit
    puts("Segmentation Fault");
    exit(0);
  }

  // ----- Start Parent Process -----

  // User must enter pid of the child process ("lost my Kid's ID")
  read(pipefd[0], kidid, 29);
  scanf("%d", &userinput);
  if ( userinput == pid )
  {
    // Did the user place a breakpoint on the lol() function? If so, exit.
    if ( *((char *)lol + 3) == 0xCC ) {
      puts(":D");
      exit(1);
    }

    // Got the kid ID from child process, now derive the key from it
    printf("\nGo for the Key!\n ");
    lol(kidid);
  }

  wait(0);
  return 0;
}
```

So the child sends an ID to the parent and then exits. The parent does a simple anti-debugging check by seeing if the user placed a breakpoint on the main function. Recall that 0xCC corresponds to an `int3` instruction, which is a software breakpoint. A debugger normally places this instruction after the function prologue (hence the +3).

Using the latest IDA version we can remove the `userinput == pid` if-test using the Edit -> Patch Program -> "Change byte" and "Apply patches to input file". Replacing it with NOPs gives:

```nasm
call    ___isoc99_scanf
mov     eax, [esp+24h]
cmp     eax, [esp+20h]
nop
nop
mov     eax, offset lol
```

While we’re at it, let’s also remove the call to `scanf`. Now we don’t need to worry anymore about giving the correct input. The `lol` function performs some calculations and ends with the following `if`-test:

```nasm
mov     [ebp+var_C], 0
cmp     [ebp+var_C], 1
jnz     short _nope_not_this

mov     eax, offset format ; "%s"
lea     edx, [ebp+var_13]
mov     [esp+4], edx
mov     [esp], eax      ; format
call    _printf
jmp     short _return

_nope_not_this:
mov     eax, offset aNope_not_this_ ; ASCII string "Nope_Not_This_:("
mov     [esp], eax      ; format
call    _printf
```

In other words, it always jumps to `\_nope\_not\_this`, because it’s a hardcoded `if`-test that compares `0` with `1`. If we again patch away this `if`-test using NOPs it will `printf` some string that was generated by the function. This string turns out to be the solution to the challenge: `dignige`.
